Fry @garlic{3%clove} and @ginger{2%inch} in @oil. While frying, chop or shred most of a @napa cabbage{1%head}. Let cook down. While it's cooking down, cut @pork ribs{0.75%lbs} into bite-sized pieces. Flour & pepper optional. When cabbage is cooked down, add pork. Juice @lemon{1} and @lime{1} into the pot and throw rind into pot. Add @chili garlic sauce{1.5%tbsp} (or sriracha) and cover pot. When pork is fully cooked, remove and discard lemon and lime rinds.  

Tofu and Chicken are reasonable substitutes for the pork in this recipe. Beef is not a great choice for this.
